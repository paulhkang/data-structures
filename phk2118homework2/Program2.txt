Enqueue:

The big-O running time is O(1), because it is pushing onto a stack built from a linked list. Because the push()
method pushes onto the front of the list, it is an O(1) operation, and the enqueue is simply a push onto the stack.


Dequeue:

The big-O running time is O(N), because in the worst case scenario, stack 2 is full (with N objects).
In this case, popping the stack N times would be an O(N) operation.
