-- MyArrayList.java --
it's a generic (<AnyType>)



doClear()
	sets theSize to 0,
	ensures that the array has enough capacity to fit DEFAULT_CAPACITY



ensureCapacity(int newCapacity)
	if capacity fits, then simply return

	if not, create array "old", as a copy of "theItems"
	set the original "theItems" equal to a new object array of size newCapacity, then cast the type into AnyType
		you have to cast, because you can't create an array of AnyType; you have to create an array of objects, then cast it
	then it copies all the old stuff to theItems


isEmpty()
	returns 0 if array is empty



get(int idx)
	returns a particular element in the array




add(AnyType x)
	calls the overloaded add() method, which adds the value to the end of the array

add(int idx, AnyType x)
	uses ensureCapacity to reallocate array size to ensure that the array will fit the new value
	
	for loop starts at theSize, and moves backwards until you are one past the location that you want to insert the value
		shifts everything towards the end
	then it puts the new value in at the idx, and increments theSize





toString()
	StringBuilder
		when using the + operator to concatenate strings, you create a new string with each + operator, creating a shitload of useless strings in memory
		StringBuilder lets you avoid this


	we're having it iterate across itself; "this" is the implicit argument for the current element
		this is an enhanced for loop, which automatically iterates throughout the collection. (look up enhanced for loops for more info)








class ArrayListIterator
	this is a NESTED CLASS!

	nested class
		a class that's defined inside of another class
		ArrayListIterator is defined inside of the MyArrayList class

		2 kinds of nested classes: static and non-static
			static has the static keyword, non-static has no static keyword

			a non-static nested class is called an inner class.
				if you are an inner class, you are granted access to the instance variables of the outer class.
				instances of ArrayListIterator have access to the instance variables of MyArrayList.
					e.g. theItems, theSize


			a non-static METHOD of MyArrayList is attached to a specific MyArrayList


	hasNext() checks if the current location is smaller than the size of the MyArrayList(?)
		size() is coming from the outer class



	**++ operator
		if ++ is put after the variable (i++), does the statement, THEN increments by 1
		if ++ is put before the variable (++i), increments, THEN does the statement



	remove()
		MyArrayList.this.remove( --current );
			MyArrayList.this is a notation that means the outer object. MyArrayList.this.remove is the remove() method from the outer MyArrayList class.
			there's 2 remove methods: one in both the inner and outer classes.
			after removing the current, then set okToRemove to false.

			remove() removes the value "behind" your current location; you must move past the element to be removed before you can remove it.



	implements Iterator on AnyType
