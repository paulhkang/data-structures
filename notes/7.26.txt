Quadratic probing hash table

We have our constructor, let's do the insert method.

	We need a method that's going to find a location at which we should be inserting.
		
		findPos( AnyType x) does this
		within the while loop: {offset += 2;}		???

	
	then check, is the current position active?
		isActive( int a ) shows whether the value at that position has been lazily deleted (false) or not (true)
		
		if the current position is active, return insert() as false


	moving on, if the current position is null, then we want to insert.
		increment occupied.

	create new HashEntry<>() at array[ currentPosition ], and also increment theSize.






rehash()
	allocates new array to a new size, which is the next prime after twice the size of the old array
	
	copies the old table over.




remove( AnyType x )
	use findPos() to find where it should be
	set isActive( currentPos ) to false			(lazy deletion)
		and do other shit





contains( AnyType x )
	checks to see whether the hash table contains the specified value.
		
		




myhash( AnyType x)
	hashes x, mods it by table size, makes sure the result isnt negative.

-- BinaryHeap.java --
insert()
	looking at the for loop: array[0] is used as temporary storage. (put x into array[0]).





percolateDown()
	make child the left child. (to begin with)
