This code was written by Paul Kang (UNI: phk2118) for Prof. Blaer's COMSS3134 course.





FILES FOR PROBLEM 1:
Problem1.java
Creates an array of rectangles, arbitrarily fills out the array, and prints out the length, width, and perimeter of largest rectangle.

Compile using any java compiler, and run using a JVM. 
	Note: Rectangle.java must be compiled before running Problem1, as Problem1 extends Rectangle.




Rectangle.java
Defines the Rectangle class used in Problem1.java.

Compile using any java compiler.











FILES FOR PROBLEM 2:
Problem2.java
Creates a rectangle array, and arbitrarily fills it.
Sorts the rectangle array.
Implements a binary search on the rectangle array given a user inputted rectangle.
	Inputs are rectangle length and width.
	e.g. "java Problem2 2 4" for a rectangle of length 2 and width 4.

	This binary search uses a public driver and a private helper function.


	Note: Rectangle.java must be compiled before running Problem2, as Problem2 extends Rectangle.


Compile using any java compiler, and run using a JVM.













FILES FOR PROBLEM 3:
Problem3.java
Implements the given code fragments, and prints out their results, and millisecond runtimes for each fragment.
For fragment 3, it also prints out a nanosecond runtime.

Compile using any java compiler, and run using a JVM.
